# Clarent (Gaming Split Ergonomic Keyboard)

## Problems with conventional solutions

### Do nothing

- Column stagger good for regular typing, but the stagger is offset when home row is moved to WASD when gaming
- Thumb/space placement is also moved when using WASD
- Only control key on bottom left, missing a control for additional inputs (can’t move to thumb cluster, control key often use in conjunction with space key)

### Remapping game

- Original thumb space key is tap-dance for command/mod key. The short press key for Tap-dance is read on the falling edge, which is not good enough for gaming
- A lot of games to remap
- Not enough keys on the right of WASD for additional key-binds
- Additional keys on the left, but pinky and ring finger is less dexterous than pointer finger

### Gaming layer

- Removes an entire column from the keyboard, can’t type normally
- Needs pressing of a button, sometimes forget to switch layers even with visual cue (RGB)

## Sliding Mechanism

- Use sacrificial layers for bridging
- Add thin sand-able spacers to adjust tolerances after printing
- Use gears??
- Remove sliding mechanism, use pairs of compliant mechanism free-floating

## Bi-stable Column Stagger

- Compliant mechanism
- Design stress points to be along a curve, not a point
- Multipart to avoid living hinges (stress on a point)
- Nylok nuts to allow for pivot without overtightening

## Key Layout

- Left Side
    - Extra Shift key next to Control
    - More horizontally angled Space Bar to allow for home-row Shift
- Right side
    - Extra Enter key to avoid tap-dance requirement of Shift and Enter
