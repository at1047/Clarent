Problem:

- How to create a two bistable environments with different amplitudes for the pinky and ring finger column

Solutions:

- Sliding, bumps at the extremities to hold sliding part in place
    - lots of friction
    - wear out over time
    - hard to tolerance with fdm
- Sliding in general is hard to tolerance and wears out, and hard to make smooth
- I want smooth
- Compliant mechanism

- Will have fatigue stress at the joints

- Use actual joints at the two ends, the whole moving part is a curve so can decide amplitude based on where the joint is attached on the curve

- Started to look for ways to implement the mechanism I chose. First layout based on Keebio Iris Iâ€™ve been using for multiple years now

- Added additional thumb key, designed base to be easily printable using fdm
    - Controller holder separated from main base because the overhangs would be extremely hard to print otherwise, all features on opposite side of main base

- Added slight tilt to thumb keys for better ergonomics

- Reduced base length so keyboard can be lower while tented, added chamfers and TPU feet holes
